    /*Main Problems in Array:
    1. Arrays sizes always fixed, at the runtime we can not increase and decrease a size,
     suppose if i want to store more than elements still there is a problem and  store less no. of
     elements still the memory will be wested.
    2. Homogeneous Data- we can store only same data type
    3. Data Structure - we can not use any ready-made  method in array*/
